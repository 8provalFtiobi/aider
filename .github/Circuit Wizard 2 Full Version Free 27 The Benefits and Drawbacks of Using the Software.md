1. Launch Circuit Wizard 2 and select "New Circuit Design" from the "File" menu.
2. From the "Components" toolbar, drag and drop a 555 timer IC, a capacitor, a resistor and an LED onto the design area.
3. Connect the components as shown in the figure below. You can use the "Wire" tool from the "Tools" toolbar to draw wires between the pins of the components. You can also use the "Label" tool to add labels to the components and wires.
4. Double-click on the components to edit their properties. For example, you can change the value of the capacitor to 10 uF, the value of the resistor to 10 kOhm and the color of the LED to red.
5. Click on the "Simulation" button from the "Tools" toolbar to start the simulation. You should see the LED flashing on and off on your screen. You can also use the "Oscilloscope" tool to measure the voltage across the LED.
6. If you are satisfied with your circuit design, you can save it as a file or export it as a PCB layout. You can also print it or share it with others.

Congratulations! You have successfully designed and simulated a simple LED flasher circuit using Circuit Wizard 2. You can try to modify the circuit or create your own circuits using different components and features. Circuit Wizard 2 is a versatile and powerful software program that can help you learn and enjoy electronics and engineering.
